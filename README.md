# CLI-app-using-Click-python-library-

I am a Bioinformatics Post-Graduate, highly interested in the field of NGS data analysis and genome data analysis. During the course of a bioinformatics internship, I did, at a renowned Cancer Research Institute, I dealt with a lot of command line tools (bioinformatics) to establish my day to day work, for example tools like PennCNV, Samtools, Bedtools, etc. These are all fantastic, easy to use tools, which need to be executed from the terminal. At the same time my work also, involved a bit of Python scripting. This exposure , made me fall in love with Python, Linux and the amazing CLI tools. So I thought why not utilise the best of both worlds, and take a go at how we can use Python to build these amazing CLI tools. After some googling, I came across this wonderful python library called "Click", which can be effectively used to build user friendly CLI tools. So here I start my journey on learning to build CLI tools using python, with Udemy, Youtube and professor Google as my allies.

 And, as I start this journey, I am going to document it all on my github repository, to make it accessible to you all out there, as well so that I can keep a  track of my progess and learning curve. I am going to begin my journey by replicating some of the applications I have learnt from Udemy and youtube tutorials, however as I Proceed and get better at it, I am goign to modify those codes, to try and make them better, and also try to build my own tools. 

Finally, here's a little introduction about Click, from its official site- (https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/)
Click is a Python package for creating beautiful command line interfaces in a composable way with as little code as necessary. It’s the “Command Line Interface Creation Kit”. It’s highly configurable but comes with sensible defaults out of the box.

It aims to make the process of writing command line tools quick and fun while also preventing any frustration caused by the inability to implement an intended CLI API.
Click in three points:
1)arbitrary nesting of commands
2)automatic help page generation
3)supports lazy loading of subcommands at runtime

###If you have happened to land on this repository, I hope you have fun, happy learning!###
